# Protein Dynamics Analyzer (RMSD/RMSF via ProDy)

This is a FastAPI-based web application that analyzes molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using **ProDy**. It computes and visualizes **RMSD** and **RMSF** values based on uploaded **PDB** and **DCD** files, helping users explore protein flexibility and motion at the Cα atom level.
